Project Title: BadBank Project

Description/Motivation: This is a React-based banking application that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as deposits and cash withdrawals. The app maintains and displays the current balance of the user's account and logs each transaction.  This is a good app for new developers to see the three tiers of an application and how the communicate and function with each other

Technology used: HTML, javascript, react, bootstrap, docker, mongoDB, node, express, firebase.

Features: As of now you have pages to login to check your balance, withdrawal and make deposits.  I am in the process of refactoring that to one page so you can see all of that information in one page.
